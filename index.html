    <h1>CPUs these days for every pc builder</h1>

    <main>
    <P>CPUs are essentially the brains of computers responsible for interpreting
        instructions and processing data. There are two major high-performance 
        desktop CPU players in the market: Intel and AMD.</P>
    
 <P style="color:red;">firstly,Here's AMD processors line up:
  <b><u>AMD starts with Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5, an upgrade over legacy Athlon and 
    Sempron lines.</u></b></P>
  <P> 
Ryzen 3 and 5 : Suitable for casual gaming and office applications.
</P>  
<p>
Although most Ryzen 3 and 5 processors offer simultaneous multithreading (SMT), the very entry-level Ryzen 3 products do not. Make 
sure you check before you buy. AMD processors with “G” at the end 
feature integrated graphics; all other Ryzen processors will require a 
separate graphics card even to display an output.
</p>
<p>
Ryzen 7 : The Ryzen 7 has more cores, and this line is suitable for 
gaming at a mid-tier level.
</p>
<p>
Ryzen 9 : Ryzen 9 chips currently have the most cores when we’re 
talking about the mainstream consumer CPU segment – making them 
great for both high-end gaming and CPU-intensive tasks like video 
editing and rendering. The top-end Ryzen 9 processor boasts 16 cores 
and 32 threads.
</p>
<p>
Threadripper and Epyc : AMD’s top-tier Threadripper and more powerful Epyc CPUs are geared towards the workstation and server market.

<P style="color:blue;"><u><b>Here's intel line up:</b></u></P>
</header>
<main>
<p> 
    Celeron series: A series that houses Intel’s entry-level products. It caters to 
    users who don’t need to handle CPU-intensive work. Celerons are suitable for 
    users who just need something to handle tasks like watching/streaming 
    videos, surfing the web, or running Office applications (word processing, 
    spreadsheets, presentations, and so on).
</p>
<p>
    Pentium series: Offers a higher level of performance than the Celeron but 
    features weaker integrated graphics performance and a smaller cache than 
    the Intel Core series.
</p>
<p>
<b>Core series:  The current mainstream Intel CPU lineup.</b> 
</p>
<p>
    Core X and Xeon:Tailored for workstations and servers. These processors 
    usually feature higher core counts and more enterprise features than other 
    processors in Intel’s product lineup.
</p>
<p>
    Core i3:Perfect for tackling daily tasks, light gaming, watching videos, 
    and browsing the web.
</p>
<p>
    Core i5:The Intel 10th generation i5 processors have up to 6 cores and 
    12 threads. They (the non-F models) also come equipped with 
    decent integrated graphics, making them suitable for light 
    gaming/graphics editing.
    </p>
    <p>
    Core i7: Deliver exceptional performance and boast significantly better 
    multitasking abilities than the weaker processors in Intel’s 
    lineup. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Core i9:It can run most games and heavier applications like 
    graphics editing software programs effortlessly.
    The most powerful processor in the Intel Core family. They are 
    perfect for hardcore gamers, streamers, and content creators.
